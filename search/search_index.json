You need an assets folder and a pack.mcmeta . Here is a tutorial: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack Create the folder assets/minecraft/models/item and then the item which you want to create a custom texture, for example iron_sword.json Then copy this: { \"parent\" : \"item/handheld\" , \"textures\" : { \"layer0\" : \"item/iron_sword\" }, \"overrides\" : [ { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 1 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/1\" } ] } To add multiple custom items to this item, duplicate the section after the overrides and add a comma. Set the cutom_model_data and the model a value higher, for example: { \"parent\" : \"item/handheld\" , \"textures\" : { \"layer0\" : \"item/iron_sword\" }, \"overrides\" : [ { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 1 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/1\" }, { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 2 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/2\" }, { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 3 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/3\" }, { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 4 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/4\" }, { \"predicate\" : { \"custom_model_data\" : 5 }, \"model\" : \"item/iron_sword/5\" } ] } Create the model folders. Here we have say minecraft, the item is in assets/item/iron_sword/1.json . When you have more than one custom item, you must create the files too. You must create a folder iron_sword and a file 1.json Copy this to the 1.json : { \"parent\" : \"item/handheld\" , \"textures\" : { \"layer0\" : \"item/emerald_sword\" } } Replace emerald_sword to the name for your sword. * Move your image of the custom item in the folder, you set in the 1.json .
