            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ItemMods has its first birthday! Happy birthday! Come to <a href="https://go.linwood.dev/itemmods-discord">the discord</a> to
celebrate this! I rewrote the plugin.</p><p>Here are the highlights:</p><ul><li>Every item and block is in a pack and have its own file in the pack directory</li><li>GUI improvements: tabs, smaller gui, ...</li><li>Resource pack generator: The plugin will build a resource pack for you. You only need to add a preset, and the
required textures</li><li>New translation api: It&#x27;s easier to translate. I added crowdin to give the opinion to add their own language to the
plugin</li><li>New docs: I created an own website for the plugin. Here you can see all news, documentation and more. See
it <a href="https://itemmods.linwood.dev">here</a></li><li>Remove nms dependency, added nbt api</li><li>Follow the semantic versioning 2.0: Every version is named in the following schema: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The alpha, beta
and release candidates has a number after it (for example 2.0.0-alpha.0)</li></ul><p>And here is the first release in 2021 for ItemMods! Have fun. The docs are not finished, so please use the discord for
questions.</p><p>Thank you for waiting :)</p>]]></content:encoded>
